I am originally from [Terrassa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrassa), a city near **Barcelona**, Spain. I lived in Terrassa through all my education, and I attended the [Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat) for my undergrad studies, and then joined the High-Energy Physics Institute ([IFAE](http://www.ifae.es/eng/)) for my masters and PhD, under the supervision of [Professor Ramon Miquel](https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/ramon-miquel-pascual-389). That institute is part of the [Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology](https://bist.eu). 

After my PhD, in 2017, I moved to the city of Philadelphia (USA), to join the [University of Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania), and work with [Professor Gary M. Bernstein](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/garyb/). I currently live in **West Philadelphia** with my family.

## Outreach

I think outreach and science communication consititute a final goal of the research process, and hence they are not a separate, optional task that adds to the duties of a scientist. Also, scientific outreach provides a privileged way of stimulating and attracting curious and talented young students at an early stage of their lives, who will constitute the future generations of scientists, and to raise public awareness towards the importance and value of science in our society. Even more importantly, it provides scientists with a voice to speak up for equity, inclusion and justice in the sciences and society. For all these reasons, I am always happy to participate in outreach events. If you are interested and have some proposal, please feel free to contact me!
