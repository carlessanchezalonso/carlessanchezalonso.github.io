I am a physicist working at the intersection between astronomical data, theory and statistics. I am interested in cosmology as probed by the large-scale structure of the Universe and its weak gravitational lensing effect, and hence I work with data from galaxy surveys. During my career, I have made several contributions to the success of imaging surveys as a new key cosmological probe, focusing on overcoming their limitations and reinforcing their strengths, and I have worked with data from the [Dark Energy Survey (DES)](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org). In particular, I have been the lead author of a number of key DES publications, such as the first photometric redshift analysis, the first cosmological results from the combination of large-scale structure and weak gravitational lensing, and pioneering studies with cosmic voids. I also spend time developing and applying new inference techniques that enable a principled and Bayesian analysis of galaxy survey data, including the modeling and characterization of their limiting systematic effects, and I have recently published a number of essential analyses on those lines.

## Cosmology from the combination of large-scale structure and weak gravitational lensing

Galaxy surveys provide a view of the large-scale structure of the Universe (LSS) by obtaining information about millions of distant galaxies through extensive observation of the night sky. The distribution of galaxies, tracing the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe, is related to the total matter distribution, the one carrying cosmological information, but just in a biased way, as galaxies only exist in rather dense dark matter environments. However, the weak gravitational lensing (WL) effect, inducing correlations in the shapes of distant galaxies due to the presence of gravitational fields between those galaxies and us, is sensitive to the total matter field. Therefore, by combining LSS and WL we can break the degeneracies with the galaxy bias and access the cosmological information contained in the growth of cosmic structures and the local expansion rate.


## Characterizing Photometric Redshifts

Extracting cosmological information from imaging surveys requires the estimation and char- acterization of the redshift distributions of galaxy samples using broadband photometry. Critically, with the increase of statistical power as current and especially future photometric surveys collect more data, the systematic errors from redshift mis-calibration constitute one of the most important roadblocks to access cosmological information and to reveal the nature of dark energy. During my carrer I have lead a number of crucial publications that granted me a world-leading role in the field of photometric redshift characterization.

## Cosmic voids and void lensing

Cosmic voids are large, nearly empty regions in space surrounded by a filamentary network of galaxies and dark matter. Due to their low matter density, voids are extremely sensi- tive to diffuse components such as dark energy, and hence represent ideal entities to study modifications of gravity, and also provide independent and complementary information to galaxy-based studies. However, no void studies existed for imaging surveys given the diffi- culty of detecting them due to photometric redshift errors. That situation changed when in Sánchez et al. (2017) I developed a novel void finder designed for minimizing the im- pact of such errors, and I successfully performed the first measurement of void lensing in a photometric survey. That study constitutes a milestone for void science, as it unlocks void analyses from the huge amount of data coming from imaging surveys. As an example, the void finder I developed has later been used to analyze the late-time Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect via the CMB imprint in voids (Kovács, Sánchez et al. 2017,2019), an effect which has presented excess signals in the past (Granett et al. 2008). Furthermore, as another example, the void finder has also been used to trace the relationship between mass and light in void environments (Fang et al. 2019).
