Here I will describe some of my scientific research and interests. For an explanation of the main concepts, such as what is cosmology or a galaxy survey, it might be useful to check the blog. If you have any inquiries, please feel free to contact me.  

I am a physicist working at the intersection between astronomical data, theory and Bayesian statistics. I am interested in cosmology as probed by the large-scale structure of the Universe and its weak gravitational lensing effect, but also in cosmic voids, the connection between galaxies and dark matter halos, and galaxy lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). I focus on developing and applying new inference techniques that enable a principled and Bayesian analysis of galaxy survey data, including the modeling and characterization of their limiting systematic effects.

Photometric galaxy surveys are currently testing the limits of the Î›CDM cosmological model, and are now producing constraints which can compete in precision with those from CMB experiments like Planck. During my career, I have made crucial contributions to the success of imaging surveys as a new key cosmological probe, focusing on overcoming their limitations and reinforcing their strengths. In particular, I have been the lead author of a number of key publications from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), such as the first photometric redshift analysis, the first cosmological results from the combination of large-scale structure and weak gravitational lensing, and pioneering studies with cosmic voids. In addition, I have recently published a number of essential analyses enabling a principled and Bayesian analysis of imaging galaxy surveys.
