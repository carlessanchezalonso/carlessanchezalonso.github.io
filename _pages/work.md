I am a physicist working at the intersection between astronomical data, theory and statistics. I am interested in cosmology as probed by the large-scale structure of the Universe and its weak gravitational lensing effect, and hence I work with data from galaxy surveys. During my career, I have made crucial contributions to the success of imaging surveys as a new key cosmological probe, focusing on overcoming their limitations and reinforcing their strengths, and I have mostly worked with data from the [Dark Energy Survey (DES)](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org). In particular, I have been the lead author of a number of key DES publications, such as the first photometric redshift analysis, the first cosmological results from the combination of large-scale structure and weak gravitational lensing, and pioneering studies with cosmic voids. I also spend time developing and applying new inference techniques that enable a principled and Bayesian analysis of galaxy survey data, including the modeling and characterization of their limiting systematic effects, and I have recently published a number of essential analyses on those lines.
