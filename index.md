Hello! I am [**Carles SÃ¡nchez**](about/), a postdoctoral researcher at the *Department of Physics and Astronomy* of the [University of Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania), where I work at the intersection between astronomical data, theory and statistics. I am interested in **cosmology** as probed by the large-scale structure of the Universe, and I focus on developing and applying new inference techniques that enable a principled and Bayesian analysis of astronomical data.

Personally, I very much enjoy *telling stories with data*, from early exploration to conclusions through analysis and visualization. In the [Blog](articles/), I write about some of the science I do, its context and particularly about specific methods that can be used for other purposes. I also present some analyses I do of **public data sets**, which even though they are unrelated to cosmology, they are interesting to analyze through a similar lens. I think it is important for citizens to use data to learn about the society around them, if possible. There are some stories about photography in there, too. 

More formally, descriptions of my main scientific projects can be found in [Research](work/). In those I try to include some context as well as some graphical representations. Also, here is my full academic [**CV**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hd4oz11je1top9m/cv_publist_csanchez.pdf?raw=1), and my publications are also listed in Google Scholar and ORCID. 

[Here](about/) you can learn more [about me](about/), including a list of past jobs. There you will also find some **outreach** projects I participated in. I think of outreach as one of the ultimate goals of scientific research, and not a separate task that adds to the duties of a scientist. And even more importantly, it is also a great opportunity to stimulate and improve **equity, diversity and inclusion** in science and society in general.
