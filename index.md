Hello! I am [**Carles SÃ¡nchez**](about/), a postdoctoral researcher at the *Department of Physics and Astronomy* of the [University of Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania), where I work at the intersection between astronomical data, theory and statistics. I am interested in **cosmology** as probed by the large-scale structure of the Universe, and I focus on developing and applying new inference techniques that enable a principled and Bayesian analysis of astronomical data.

Personally, I very much enjoy to *tell stories with data*, from early exploration to conclusions through analysis and visualization. In the [Blog](articles/), I write about some of the science I do, its context and particularly about specific methods that can be used for other purposes. I also present some analyses I do of **public data sets**, which even though they are unrelated to cosmology, they are interesting to analyze through a similar lens. There is some photography there, too. 

More formally, descriptions of my main scientific projects can be found in [Work](work/). In those I try to include some context as well as some graphical representations. Also, here is my full academic **CV**.
