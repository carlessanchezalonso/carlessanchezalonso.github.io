Hello! I am [**Carles SÃ¡nchez**](about/), a postdoctoral researcher at the *Department of Physics and Astronomy* of the [University of Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania), where I work at the intersection between astronomical data, theory and statistics. I am interested in **cosmology** as probed by the large-scale structure of the Universe, and I focus on developing and applying new inference techniques that enable a principled and Bayesian analysis of astronomical data.

  This could also be the good place to say were you are coming from, what you [do for a living](work/) and maybe what you are [interested in](projects/). You might also be [writing](articles/) about stuff.

  But after all this is your site and I'm just a **placeholder text** so what would i know about some *home page content*.
